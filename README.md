# **weather50**

Hi! My name Atha Putra, I am from surakarta, a small city in Jawa Tengah, Indonesia. My beloved country, Indonesia has a tropical climate, which only has 2 season, wet and dry.

With this climate, we expect weather uncertainty and rainfall throughout the year, and to solve this problem, I created an app, weather50.


## What is weather50?

weather50 is a web-based weather app created to see weather forecast in a particular city. In this app, there are 2 main features. The first one is, of course, weather forecast. This feature displays the weather in a city you select and also the weather forecast for the upcoming weeks. The second feature is autocomplete. You don't need to type the full name of your desired city. Just type the first few letters and we will suggest cities that match your input. You can see the demonstration video here:

## What are the features?

weather50 has 2 main features. One, obviously, weather forecast. This feature is used to see the weather in a city during that time and around the week. Second, autocomplete. With this feature you don't need to worry about entering a complete name of your city. You just need to enter the first couple letter of your city and we will complete the rest.


# Technology used

## HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.

## CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets language and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site. The relation between HTML and CSS is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that is used to create more dynamic interactions when developing web pages, applications, servers, and or even games.

## React

The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than with vanilla JavaScript.

## API

API is the acronym for application programming interface, a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations. In weather50 we use 2 API:

**1. OpenWeatherMap**\
OpenWeatherMap is an online service, owned by OpenWeather Ltd, that provides global weather data via API, including current weather data, forecasts, nowcasts and historical weather data for any geographical location.

**2. GeoDB Cities**\
GeoDB Cities provides basic info about cities, counties, regions, and countries throughout the world. This is used for the autocomplete feature.


# Suggestions
This web app is far from perfect. There are quite few things that can be improved, such as:

1. Design\
Design of the web page could be improved a lot to improve user friendliness.

2. Responsive\
weather50 is not currently responsive and can only be used on larger device. This wil be improved in the next update.
